    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The $1 Healthy Bowl is a rice bowl that is highly cost efficient for the amount of nutrients that you get from it. 
        In theory, it should cost about $1 to make. I'm not really sure if that's actually true or not because this recipe was invented 
        by a Youtuber that is known for clickbaits. It still tastes good tho...</p>
