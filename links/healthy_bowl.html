    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The $1 Healthy Bowl is a rice bowl that is highly cost efficient for the amount of nutrients that you get from it. 
        In theory, it should cost about $1 to make. I'm not really sure if that's actually true or not because this recipe was invented 
        by a Youtuber who is known for clickbaits. It still tastes good tho...</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <p>
        <strong><u>Rice</u></strong>
        <ol>
        <li>Before cooking the rice, wash thoroughly 2x.</li>
        <li>Place into a rice cooker and add water.</li>
        <li>Cook until rice is fully cooked.

        </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><u>Chicken</u></strong>
        <ol>
        <li>in a small pot, add soy sauce, white vinegar, and honey; place it on the stove over medium-high, bring it to a boil, and reduce for one minute. </li>
        <li>While that is cooking, in a separate bowl, combine cornstarch, and water, whisk until dissolved. Add Â¾ quarters of your slurry to the soy sauce 
            mixture, stir in, let it boil for 30 seconds or until thickened, and remove from the heat. (Add the rest of the slurry if it is not thick enough.)</li>
        <li>Skewer your chicken thighs under wooden skewers, about 6 to 8 total skewers, lightly grease those chicken pieces with spray oil, generously season 
            them with salt and pepper on all sides. </li>
        <li>Preheat a grill to medium-high heat or a pan, grease your grill, place on your skewers, cook for 5 to 10 minutes turning every minute or so. </li>
        <li>As soon as you cook them all the way through, brush them on all sides with your glaze, and place them on high heat to caramelize. Remove and repeat with the rest. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><u>Peanut Sauce</u></strong>
        <ol>
        <li>Place sugar in a medium-size pot, soy sauce, white vinegar. Stir and heat to dissolve; allow to cool slightly, add sriracha, peanut butter, and garlic. </li>
        <li>Whisk all together, and reserve in the fridge. (Depending on your peanut butter, you might have to add 60ml of water and 4g of cornstarch.) </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><u>Toppers</u></strong>
        <ol>
        <li>Soft boiled eggs.- In a pot with boiling water slightly under medium-high heat, add eggs, boil for 6 minutes and 30 seconds, immediately remove from the 
            water, and place in an ice bath for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slightly crack the shell all over the egg, peel it off under a stream of water, pat dry with a paper towel, and cut it in half. </li>
        <li>Season your julienned carrots with salt, lime juice, sesame oil, and toss together until evenly coated. Season your avocado slices with flaky salt and lime juice. </li>
        <li>Assembly.- In a bowl, add your desired amount of rice, followed by one or 2 of your chicken skewers. Next, gently place your carrots, followed by two or three pieces of cucumbers.</li>
        <li>Then, place one or two halves of your soft boil egg, a handful of green onion, a generous dollop of your spicy peanut sauce, and crushed peanuts on top. Finally, add your avocado 
            and drizzle some glaze on your chicken. </li>
        </ol>
